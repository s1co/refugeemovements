                            Kenya, Yemen and Djibouti are important transit and host countries for refugees originating within the Great Horn of Africa region.
                        </p>
                <p>The refugee populations in Kenya, Yemen and Djibouti are strongly influenced by the political situation in Somalia. Changes in the refugee policies in these three countries could dramatically affect refugee movements in the region.</p>

                        <h3> Kenya </h3>
                        <p>
                            Kenya is a critical hub for refugee movements from the Great Horn of Africa region. Most of these refugees live in camps in the north of the country. The Kenyan Government has repeatedly threatened to close one or more refugee camps and to relocate the refugees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1992, the number of refugees in Kenya increased sharply from 15,000 to 380,000 in the course of two years.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            In the following years, Kenya became the most important host country peaking at 570,000 refugees in 2011.

                        <p>
                            Regularly, the vast majority of the refugees were Somalis.

                        <h3> Yemen </h3>
                        <p>
                            Yemen has long been and still is an important host and transit country for refugees on the way to Saudi Arabia. Since the outbreak of the Yemeni Civil War in 2012, the number of Yemenis displaced internally and externally has rapidly increased.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Along with the conflicts in Somalia, the Somali refugee population in Yemen has increased steadily.

                    <h3> Djibouti</h3>

                    <p>
                        Djibouti has traditionally hosted many refugees in transit between the Great Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Since the beginning of the war in Yemen, Djibouti increasingly hosts Yemeni refugees.
